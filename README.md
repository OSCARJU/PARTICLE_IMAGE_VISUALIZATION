# PARTICLE_IMAGE_VISUALIZATION
Program developed in Matlab to improve the results of PIVLAB
The PIV system computes a pair of images captured by the CMOS camera within a time delay or sampling time of âˆ†t, therefore image processing has an important relevance in measurement by PIV method. Variables are calculated by using cross correlation technique implemented in PIVLAB, an open source library in Matlab. Our task was to find out the influence of image quality on the PIV results, with an emphasis on aerosol and flow visualization.  For this purpose, a variety of linear filters were implanted moreover a pre-trained neural network was tested to reduce the noise of the caught frames. In addition, the background subtraction algorithm was programmed and validated to avoid the reflection of particles and shadows produced by the laser sheet. The algorithms were tested in the Matlab environment, and the pictures were taken from the experiment performed in the Center for Clean Technology Research, in Taipei/Taiwan. The systems consist of a rotational laser beam (2watts output, 532 nm) and a CMOS camera, with bit depth of 16 bit, 2048x2048 pixel resolution, and a 30fps and 100fps as maximum frame rate. The videos were recorded inside a recreated mini environment (system used to produce silicon wafer) and a medical room, where the flow motion was analyzed.
